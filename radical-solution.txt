# Radical Solution

Open Doors USA could surely make their Prayer Letter available in a simple text format as well as a PDF!

Let's contact them directly.

Hi,

I'm a Volunteer doing some Software Development with PrayerMate, the Christian Prayer App (https://www.prayermate.net/).

And I've been asked to help with a project writing some code to convert your PDF monthly Prayer Letter into a simple text file that can then be injected into the app to help people receive automated prayer requests from Open Doors. I've just started: https://github.com/peterprescott/pdf-reader  

I'm quite happy to address this as a software project, but it strikes me that the simplest solution is to go straight to you and ask if you can put me in touch with whatever department is responsible for putting together the monthly Open Doors Prayer Letter. Because presumably someone has those prayer points as simple text before they are released as a PDF.

Please let me know who the relevant person is to discuss this with.

Thanks!

Peter Prescott
